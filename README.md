Developed a dynamic Kotlin-based Android application inspired by TripAdvisor, providing users with an interactive platform to explore hotels, restaurants, and adventure destinations. Key features include:
<br><br>
Adventure Experience Management: Users can dynamically add, edit, and delete adventure posts with images and descriptions.
<br><br>
Account Management: Implemented Firebase Authentication for secure user account management.
<br><br>
Dynamic Data Synchronization: Leveraged Retrofit for real-time data fetching and updates from a .NET server, with automatic periodic synchronization.
<br><br>
Local Data Storage: Used SQLite for efficient local storage and real-time management of fetched data.
<br><br>
Backend Integration: Created a .NET server with RESTful APIs to manage adventure and country data, with images served from the serverâ€™s www root.
<br><br>
Image Handling: Enabled dynamic online image retrieval and display within the app.

      Tech Stack: Kotlin, Android, Retrofit, SQLite, .NET, RESTful APIs, Firebase Authentication.
       
      This project demonstrates my expertise in building dynamic, feature-rich mobile applications with robust backend       integration, effective data management, and real-time updates.
